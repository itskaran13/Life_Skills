# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### Ques1  What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can occur through touching, words, or images. When it comes to words, people may say inappropriate things, make inappropriate requests, or start rumours. It could include sexually suggestive graphics or messaging in photos. Furthermore, touching could imply inappropriate gestures or unwanted touches made by others.

### Ques 2 What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

In the event that I witness or encounter such conduct, I shall:

1. Inform a reliable person.
2. Document the events in writing.
3. Offer assistance and support to the impacted individual.
4. Check on me and, if I'm upset, talk to someone.
